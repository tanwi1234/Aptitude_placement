Speed, Time and Distance:

Speed =		Distance/time		,	Time =		Distance/speed		,	Distance = (Speed x Time).

km/hr to m/sec conversion:

x km/hr =		x x	5/18		m/sec.

m/sec to km/hr conversion:

x m/sec =		x x	18/5		km/hr.

If the ratio of the speeds of A and B is a : b, then the ratio of

the times taken by them to cover the same distance is	1/a	:	1/b or b : a.

Suppose a man covers a certain distance at x km/hr and an equal distance at y km/hr. Then,

the average speed during the whole journey is		2xy/x+y		km/hr.
